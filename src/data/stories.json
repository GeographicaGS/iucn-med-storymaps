In addition to their role as pollinators and food for others, some have even developed their own ways to deter predators and parasites, find a mate, or overcome the chemical defences of their host plant. Each of these butterfly chemicals has a potential value and could be exploited economically. Powerful antibiotics for example have been found in the Meadow Brown (Maniola jurtina), one common and widespread species."

            "value": "The last 50 years have however seen a massive change in agricultural practices across the Mediterranean, with a loss of wildlife-rich habitats by increasing urbanization and tourism infrastructure. The growing chronic water shortages are also having a major socio-economic impact on large parts of the region, as many small-scale farmers feel forced to abandon their land to search for jobs elsewhere. Land abandonment leads to former grassland getting overgrown with shrubs, turning into secondary forests and therefore reducing suitable habitats for many butterfly species. Overgrazing can reduce the availability of nutritious plants and refuge for larvae too. These changes are leading to the disappearance of some of these colourful and unique creatures."
