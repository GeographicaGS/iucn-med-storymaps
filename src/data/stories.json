The growing chronic water shortages are also having a major socio-economic impact on large parts of the region, as many small-scale farmers feel forced to abandon their land to search for jobs elsewhere. Land abandonment leads to former grassland getting overgrown with shrubs, turning into secondary forests and therefore reducing suitable habitats for many butterfly species. Overgrazing can reduce the availability of nutritious plants and refuge for larvae too. These changes are leading to the disappearance of some of these colourful and unique creatures."

The growing chronic water shortages are also having a major socio-economic impact on large parts of the region, as many small-scale farmers feel forced to abandon their land to search for jobs elsewhere. Land abandonment leads to former grassland getting overgrown with shrubs, turning into secondary forests and therefore reducing suitable habitats for many butterfly species. Overgrazing can reduce the availability of nutritious plants and refuge for larvae too. These changes are leading to the disappearance of some of these colourful and unique creatures."

The growing chronic water shortages are also having a major socio-economic impact on large parts of the region, as many small-scale farmers feel forced to abandon their land to search for jobs elsewhere. Land abandonment leads to former grassland getting overgrown with shrubs, turning into secondary forests and therefore reducing suitable habitats for many butterfly species. Overgrazing can reduce the availability of nutritious plants and refuge for larvae too. These changes are leading to the disappearance of some of these colourful and unique creatures."

The growing chronic water shortages are also having a major socio-economic impact on large parts of the region, as many small-scale farmers feel forced to abandon their land to search for jobs elsewhere. Land abandonment leads to former grassland getting overgrown with shrubs, turning into secondary forests and therefore reducing suitable habitats for many butterfly species. Overgrazing can reduce the availability of nutritious plants and refuge for larvae too. These changes are leading to the disappearance of some of these colourful and unique creatures."

Powerful antibiotics for example have been found in the Meadow Brown (Maniola jurtina), one common and widespread species."

The growing chronic water shortages are also having a major socio-economic impact on large parts of the region, as many small-scale farmers feel forced to abandon their land to search for jobs elsewhere. Land abandonment leads to former grassland getting overgrown with shrubs, turning into secondary forests and therefore reducing suitable habitats for many butterfly species. Overgrazing can reduce the availability of nutritious plants and refuge for larvae too. These changes are leading to the disappearance of some of these colourful and unique creatures."

They enable the development of vivid or indistinct patterns to help them conceal, camouflage, for mimicry and for warning potential predators. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings help absorb the sunlight and assist in regulating the body temperature. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies help communicate their toxicity or inedibility to prevent a predator from preying on it."
